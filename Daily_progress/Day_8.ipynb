    "### **_1. Catalog → Schema → Table hierarchy_**\n",
    "In Databricks **Unity Catalog**, data is organized using a **three-tier namespace**. This structure allows you to govern and find your data across the entire organization rather than just within a single workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **The 3-Tier Hierarchy**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Catalog (Tier 1):** The highest level of isolation.\n",
    "* Think of this as a \"Data Domain\" (e.g., `Sales`, `Marketing`, or `Dev`).\n",
    "* Permissions are often managed at this level (e.g., \"The Finance team owns the `Finance` catalog\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Schema / Database (Tier 2):** A grouping within a catalog.\n",
    "* This is synonymous with a \"Database\" in traditional SQL.\n",
    "* In a Medallion architecture, you might have schemas named `bronze`, `silver`, and `gold` inside a single catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Table / View (Tier 3):** The actual data object.\n",
    "* This is where your rows and columns live. It can be a physical **Table** (managed or external) or a virtual **View**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **How to Query Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "When working in a notebook, you reference data using \"Dot Notation\":\n",
    "`SELECT * FROM catalog_name.schema_name.table_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Hierarchy Components & Governance**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Level | Role | Example |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Catalog** | Organizational Unit / Environment | `production`, `sandbox` |\n",
    "| **Schema** | Functional Grouping | `raw_billing`, `refined_users` |\n",
    "| **Table** | Specific Dataset | `invoice_details`, `active_subscriptions` |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Key Benefits of this Hierarchy**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Centralized Governance:** You can grant a user access to an entire **Catalog**, and they automatically get access to every **Schema** and **Table** within it (Inheritance).\n",
    "* **Searchability:** The Databricks **Catalog Explorer** allows you to search for data across the entire 3-tier namespace, regardless of which workspace you are in.\n",
    "* **Data Lineage:** Unity Catalog tracks how data flows from a table in the `bronze` schema to a table in the `gold` schema, providing a visual map of your data's journey.\n",
    "* **Standardization:** It forces teams to stop using \"magic paths\" (like `s3://my-bucket/data/file.parquet`) and instead use clean, human-readable SQL names.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Pro-Tip: Setting the Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid typing the full 3-part name every time, you can set your session context:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "USE CATALOG production;\n",
    "USE SCHEMA gold;\n",
    "SELECT * FROM sales_report; -- Automatically looks in production.gold\n",

    "### **_2. Access control (GRANT/REVOKE)_**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Databricks **Unity Catalog**, access control follows a standard SQL syntax. Because of the **3-tier hierarchy**, permissions are hierarchical: if you grant someone access to a Catalog, they automatically inherit access to all Schemas and Tables within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. The Hierarchy of Privileges**\n",
    "\n",
    "Access \"trickles down\" from the top:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Account Admin:** Can manage all catalogs and users.\n",
    "* **Catalog Admin:** Owns a specific catalog and can create schemas.\n",
    "* **Schema Owner:** Can create tables and views within that schema.\n",
    "* **Table Owner:** Has full control over a specific table.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Common SQL Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "To give a user or group permission to see data, you typically need to grant two things: **USAGE** (the ability to \"enter\" the container) and **SELECT** (the ability to \"read\" the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Granting Read Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- 1. Allow user to \"see\" the catalog\n",
    "GRANT USAGE ON CATALOG main TO `data_analysts`;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- 2. Allow user to \"see\" the schema\n",
    "GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA main.marketing TO `data_analysts`;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- 3. Allow user to \"read\" the specific table\n",
    "GRANT SELECT ON TABLE main.marketing.customer_leads TO `data_analysts`;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Granting Write/Modify Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "If a Data Engineer needs to update a table, you would grant more powerful permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "GRANT MODIFY, SELECT ON TABLE main.marketing.customer_leads TO `data_engineers`;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Revoking Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "If a team no longer needs access, the syntax is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE main.marketing.customer_leads FROM `data_analysts`;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **3. Key Privilege Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Privilege | What it allows |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **`USAGE`** | Required to \"browse\" a Catalog or Schema. Does not give access to data. |\n",
    "| **`SELECT`** | Allows reading data from a Table or View. |\n",
    "| **`MODIFY`** | Allows `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `MERGE` operations. |\n",
    "| **`CREATE`** | Allows a user to create new Schemas (on Catalog) or Tables (on Schema). |\n",
    "| **`ALL PRIVILEGES`** | Grants everything (Admin level) for that specific object. |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **4. Best Practices for Access Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Grant to Groups, Not Users:** Always create groups (e.g., `finance_team`, `data_scientists`) in the Databricks Admin Console and grant permissions to the group. This makes it easier to manage when people join or leave the company.\n",
    "* **The Principle of Least Privilege:** Start by granting only `USAGE` and `SELECT`. Only grant `MODIFY` to automated Service Principals or Data Engineers.\n",
    "* **Use Views for Masking:** If a table contains sensitive data (like SSNs), don't grant access to the table. Instead, create a **View** that hides the sensitive columns and grant `SELECT` on that View instead.\n",
    "* **Check Permissions:** You can always see who has access to an object by running:\n",
    "`SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE main.marketing.customer_leads;`\n",

    "### **_3. Data lineage_**\n",
    "In Databricks **Unity Catalog**, **Data Lineage** is a built-in feature that automatically tracks the flow of data from its source to its ultimate destination. It provides a visual map of how tables are related, helping you understand the \"ancestry\" of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike manual documentation, Unity Catalog captures lineage **automatically** at runtime. Whenever you run a Spark query or a SQL command that reads from one table and writes to another, Databricks records that relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Table-Level Lineage:** Shows how tables depend on each other (e.g., `Bronze_Orders` flows into `Silver_Orders`).\n",
    "* **Column-Level Lineage:** Shows exactly which source columns were used to calculate a specific output column (e.g., `Revenue` in Gold is calculated from `Price` and `Quantity` in Silver).\n",
    "* **Notebook & Workflow Lineage:** Identifies which specific notebook or job was responsible for the data movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Why Data Lineage Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Impact Analysis:** If you plan to change a column name in a \"Silver\" table, you can look downstream to see exactly which \"Gold\" dashboards or ML models will break.\n",
    "* **Trust & Audit:** If an executive questions a number on a dashboard, a Data Engineer can trace it back through the layers to the original raw source file to verify its accuracy.\n",
    "* **Compliance (GDPR/CCPA):** If you need to track where a user's PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is stored, lineage helps you find every table that has touched that sensitive data.\n",
    "* **Debugging:** When a pipeline fails, lineage helps you quickly identify the \"upstream\" parent table that might contain the bad data causing the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **3. Key Visual Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Catalog Explorer**, the Lineage tab provides three views:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Upstream:** What tables/files did this data come from?\n",
    "2. **Downstream:** What tables/dashboards/models use this data?\n",
    "3. **Lineage Graph:** A full interactive map that you can expand to see the entire \"life\" of the data across catalogs and schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **4. Limitations to Keep in Mind**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unity Catalog Requirement:** Lineage only works for tables and views registered within Unity Catalog. It cannot track \"legacy\" Hive Metastore tables or raw files outside of UC management.\n",
    "* **Read-Only via UI:** While you can see lineage in the UI, you can also query it via the **System Tables** (e.g., `system.access.table_lineage`) if you want to build your own custom reporting on data flow.\n",
    "* **Real-time vs. Batch:** Lineage is updated as soon as a job completes, but it reflects the *last successful run*.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Example Use Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a `total_spend` column in your **Gold** table is suddenly showing negative values. By opening the **Lineage Graph**, you can trace the column back to a `discount_applied` field in the **Silver** layer, and eventually to a raw JSON field in **Bronze**, helping you find the exact point where the calculation logic or source data went wrong."

    "### **_4. Managed vs external tables_**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Databricks Unity Catalog, the distinction between **Managed** and **External** tables defines who controls the data's lifecycle and where that data physically lives on your cloud storage (S3, ADLS, or GCS).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. Managed Tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Managed tables are the \"default\" way to create tables in Unity Catalog. Databricks handles both the **metadata** (the table definition) and the **physical data files**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Storage Location:** Data is stored in a central \"Managed Storage\" location defined at the Catalog or Schema level.\n",
    "* **Lifecycle Control:** If you run `DROP TABLE`, Databricks deletes **both** the table definition in the catalog and the physical data files from the cloud storage.\n",
    "* **Ease of Use:** You don't need to provide a path. You simply write `CREATE TABLE name AS SELECT...` and Databricks handles the rest.\n",
    "* **Best For:** Most standard Medallion architecture layers (Silver and Gold) where Databricks is the primary tool interacting with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. External Tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "External tables (also called \"Unmanaged tables\") allow you to point Databricks at data that already exists in a specific cloud storage location.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Storage Location:** You must provide a specific path (e.g., `LOCATION 's3://my-bucket/data/orders'`).\n",
    "* **Lifecycle Control:** If you run `DROP TABLE`, Databricks **only** deletes the metadata (the table name in the catalog). The **physical files stay exactly where they are**.\n",
    "* **Sharing:** These are ideal if other tools (like Snowflake, Presto, or a legacy app) need to read the same Parquet/Delta files.\n",
    "* **Best For:** The **Bronze** layer, where you are ingesting raw data from external systems, or when you need to maintain control over the folder structure for non-Databricks tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Key Comparison Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Managed Table | External Table |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **`DROP TABLE` behavior** | Deletes Metadata + Physical Data | Deletes Metadata ONLY |\n",
    "| **Location** | Fixed (Managed Storage) | Flexible (User-defined `LOCATION`) |\n",
    "| **Data Governance** | Full Unity Catalog control | Shared with external systems |\n",
    "| **Syntax** | `CREATE TABLE table_name...` | `CREATE TABLE table_name... LOCATION 'path'` |\n",
    "| **Performance** | Optimized by Databricks | Varies based on storage layout |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **How to choose?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Managed Tables** whenever possible. They are cleaner to manage, and Unity Catalog can perform better optimizations when it has full control over the file layout.\n",
    "2. **Use External Tables** only if you have a specific requirement to keep the files in a particular folder for other applications, or if you are \"registering\" data that was written by a system outside of Databricks."
