    "### **_1. Databricks Jobs vs notebooks_**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Databricks, **Notebooks** are for development and exploration, while **Jobs** are for production and automation. Think of the Notebook as the \"draft\" and the Job as the \"scheduled execution.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. Databricks Notebooks (Development)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interactive Coding:** Designed for a \"human-in-the-loop\" experience where you run cells one by one and see results (tables/charts) immediately.\n",
    "* **Collaboration:** Multiple users can edit the same notebook simultaneously (like Google Docs) and leave comments.\n",
    "* **Manual Execution:** Typically run on **All-Purpose Clusters**, which are always \"on\" and more expensive but provide instant response for testing.\n",
    "* **Flexibility:** Easily switch between Python, SQL, Scala, and R within the same file using magic commands (`%sql`).\n",
    "* **Visualizations:** Includes built-in `display()` functions to render interactive plots and data profiles for quick analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Databricks Jobs (Production)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automation:** Used to schedule notebooks, JARs, or Python scripts to run at specific times (CRON) or in a sequence (Workflows).\n",
    "* **Job Clusters (Transient):** Jobs usually run on **Job Clusters**, which spin up when the task starts and shut down immediately after. These are **significantly cheaper** (approx. half the cost) than All-Purpose clusters.\n",
    "* **Orchestration:** Jobs allow you to create **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)** of tasks—for example: \"Run Ingest Notebook -> if success, run Transform Notebook -> if failure, send Email.\"\n",
    "* **Reliability:** Includes built-in retry logic, timeout settings, and sophisticated alerting (Email/Slack/PagerDuty) if a task fails.\n",
    "* **Parameters:** You can pass different values (like `date` or `region`) into a Job at runtime using **Widgets**, allowing one notebook to serve many different scheduled tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Key Comparison Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Notebooks | Jobs (Workflows) |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Primary Goal** | Exploration & Prototyping | Production & Automation |\n",
    "| **Compute Type** | All-Purpose Cluster (Interactive) | Job Cluster (Transient/Short-lived) |\n",
    "| **Cost** | High ($$ per DBU) | Low ($ per DBU) |\n",
    "| **Execution** | Manual / Cell-by-cell | Scheduled / Automated Trigger |\n",
    "| **Error Handling** | Manual debugging | Auto-retries & Notifications |\n",
    "| **Version Control** | Integrated Repos (Git) | Runs specific Git commits/tags |\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **The \"Best Practice\" Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Develop** your logic interactively in a **Notebook** using a small sample of data.\n",
    "2. **Modularize** the code so it can accept parameters (e.g., using `dbutils.widgets`).\n",
    "3. **Deploy** that notebook by creating a **Job** that runs it on a schedule against the full production dataset.\n"

    "### **_2. Multi-task workflows_**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Databricks, a **Multi-task Workflow** allows you to orchestrate complex data pipelines by stringing together multiple individual tasks into a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. This replaces the need for external tools like Airflow for many Lakehouse use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. Core Concepts of Multi-task Jobs**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Task Dependencies:** You can define the order of execution. For example, the \"Silver\" task only starts if the \"Bronze\" task completes successfully.\n",
    "* **Task Types:** A single workflow can mix different types of tasks, including **Notebooks**, **Python scripts**, **SQL queries**, **Delta Live Tables**, and even **dbt** projects.\n",
    "* **Shared Compute:** Multiple tasks can run on the same **Job Cluster** to save on startup time, or you can assign different clusters to different tasks based on their resource needs (e.g., a memory-heavy cluster for ML training and a small one for SQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Key Features for Production**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conditional Execution:** Use \"If/Else\" logic within the workflow (e.g., \"If the data quality check fails, run the Quarantine task; otherwise, run the Gold task\").\n",
    "* **Task Values:** Tasks can \"talk\" to each other. You can set a value in Task A (like a file path or a record count) and retrieve it in Task B using `dbutils.jobs.taskValues`.\n",
    "* **Repair and Rerun:** If a workflow with 10 tasks fails at task #8, you don't have to restart the whole thing. You can **\"Repair\"** the run, and Databricks will only execute the failed task and those that follow it.\n",
    "* **Matrix Tasks:** Allows you to run the same task multiple times in parallel with different parameters (e.g., running the same \"Report\" notebook for 50 different countries simultaneously).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **3. Workflow Triggers**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scheduled:** Traditional CRON-based timing (e.g., every day at 2:00 AM).\n",
    "* **File Arrival:** Triggered automatically as soon as new files land in your cloud storage (S3/ADLS).\n",
    "* **Continuous:** The job restarts immediately after it finishes, ideal for near real-time processing.\n",
    "* **API-based:** Triggered via an external call (e.g., from an Azure Data Factory pipeline or a GitHub Action).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **4. Best Practices for Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Modularity:** Keep your notebooks small and focused on one goal (e.g., one notebook for Bronze, one for Silver). This makes debugging much easier.\n",
    "* **Use Job Clusters:** Always use **New Job Clusters** for production to take advantage of the lower DBU pricing compared to All-Purpose clusters.\n",
    "* **Notifications:** Configure **System Notifications** for specific events (e.g., On Failure, On Duration Exceeded) to ensure your team is alerted before the business notices a delay.\n",
    "* **Timeouts:** Set a maximum completion time for each task to prevent a \"stuck\" process from wasting money and blocking the rest of the pipeline."

    "### **_3. Parameters & scheduling_**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Databricks, **Parameters** allow you to make your code dynamic, while **Scheduling** ensures your logic runs at the right time without manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. Parameters using Widgets**\n",
    "\n",
    "Widgets are the primary way to pass variables into a Databricks notebook. They allow the same notebook to be reused for different dates, regions, or data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Types of Widgets:** You can create text boxes, dropdown menus, or multi-select lists at the top of your notebook.\n",
    "* **Default Values:** Always set a default value in your code so the notebook can run even if no parameter is provided.\n",
    "* **Accessing Values:** Use the `dbutils.widgets` API to retrieve the value passed by the user or the Job.\n",
    "* **SQL Integration:** You can access these parameters directly in SQL cells using the `$parameter_name` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Python):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a text widget\n",
    "dbutils.widgets.text(\"run_date\", \"2026-01-01\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the value into a variable\n",
    "current_date = dbutils.widgets.get(\"run_date\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use it in a query\n",
    "df = spark.table(\"sales\").filter(F.col(\"date\") == current_date)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Scheduling Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "Scheduling turns your interactive notebook into a production pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CRON Expressions:** Use standard CRON syntax for complex timing (e.g., \"0 30 2 * * ?\" for every day at 2:30 AM).\n",
    "* **Simple Scheduler:** A user-friendly UI for selecting frequency (Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks).\n",
    "* **Time Zone Awareness:** Ensure you set the schedule to the correct time zone (usually UTC for global teams) to avoid confusion during Daylight Savings.\n",
    "* **Concurrent Runs:** You can control whether a second run should start if the first one is still running (**Concurrency Limit**).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **3. Advanced Triggering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond simple time-based schedules, Databricks supports event-driven triggers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **File Arrival Trigger:** The job starts as soon as a new file is detected in a specific S3 bucket or Azure Container. This is much more efficient than \"polling\" every hour.\n",
    "* **Continuous Execution:** The job runs in a loop. As soon as one run finishes, the next one starts. This is best for low-latency Delta Live Tables.\n",
    "* **API Triggering:** Use the **Jobs API** to trigger runs from external tools like Airflow, Azure Data Factory, or GitHub Actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **4. Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parameterized Paths:** Don't hardcode file paths. Use a parameter for the \"environment\" (e.g., `/mnt/data/${env}/orders`) so the same job can run in Dev, Test, and Prod.\n",
    "* **Job Parameters vs. Task Parameters:** You can set parameters at the **Job level** (available to all tasks) or the **Task level** (specific to one notebook).\n",
    "* **Monitoring Alerts:** Always set an \"On Failure\" alert to notify your team via Email or Slack if a scheduled run fails.\n",
    "* **Timeout Settings:** Define a timeout for scheduled jobs (e.g., 2 hours) so that a \"stuck\" job doesn't run forever and consume your entire budget."

    "### **_4. Error handling_**\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling in Databricks is critical for transitioning from \"it works on my machine\" to a robust production pipeline. It involves a mix of standard Python try-except blocks and Databricks-specific orchestration features.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. Notebook-Level Error Handling (Python)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Try-Except Blocks:** Use these to catch specific Spark exceptions (like `AnalysisException` for missing tables) and log them without crashing the entire cluster.\n",
    "* **Graceful Failures:** Instead of letting a job crash, use `dbutils.notebook.exit(\"Error Message\")` to stop a notebook gracefully and pass a status message back to the parent Job.\n",
    "* **Assertion Checks:** Use `assert` or `if/raise` to validate data before processing (e.g., \"Raise error if the input DataFrame is empty\").\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Workflow/Job-Level Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retries:** Configure the **Max Retries** setting in the Job UI. If a task fails due to a \"spot instance\" being reclaimed or a temporary network glitch, Databricks will automatically try again.\n",
    "* **Timeout Limits:** Set a **Timeout** for every task. If a notebook gets stuck in an infinite loop or a \"deadlock,\" Databricks will kill the task rather than letting it burn your budget.\n",
    "* **On-Failure Tasks:** Create a specific task in your Workflow that only runs if a previous task fails. This is commonly used to send a custom Slack/Email alert or \"clean up\" temporary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **3. Delta Lake \"ACID\" Safety**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Automatic Rollbacks:** Because Delta is ACID compliant, if an error occurs mid-write, Delta Lake automatically ensures no partial data is saved. You don't need to write manual \"cleanup\" code for failed writes.\n",
    "* **Expectations (DLT):** In Delta Live Tables, you can define **Expectations** to handle bad data:\n",
    "* `expect`: Track the error but allow the record.\n",
    "* `expect or drop`: Remove the specific record that failed.\n",
    "* `expect or fail`: Crash the entire pipeline if a critical error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **4. Logging and Monitoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Log4j / Python Logging:** Use the standard `logging` library to send custom logs to the **Driver Logs** tab in the cluster UI.\n",
    "* **Query Watchdog:** Enable the \"Query Watchdog\" in cluster settings to automatically kill queries that are taking up too many resources or producing an accidental \"Cartesian Product\" (huge join).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Common Pattern: The \"Try-Except-Exit\" Template**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Your Spark logic here\n",
    "    df = spark.read.table(\"bronze_data\")\n",
    "    df.write.mode(\"append\").saveAsTable(\"silver_data\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    # Log the error and exit with a failure message for the Job UI\n",
    "    error_msg = f\"Task failed: {str(e)}\"\n",
